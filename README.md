Link to the game I have developed:

I have developed this game using RenPy game engine. Background pictures were taken up from Google and sound effects were used from Pixabay and Open Game Art.
The idea was to create a horror visual novel which involves user interaction.It is developed for entertainment purpose.
In future, I look forward to add more branching of choices and creating more endings in the game. I can add mini games or side tasks to make the game more interesting and challenging. I might also improve the visuals and sound effects of the game.
